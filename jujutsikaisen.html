                        Hidden in plain sight, a centuries-old conflict rages on.
                        Supernatural monsters known as 'Curses' terrorize humanity from
                        the shadows, and powerful individuals known as 'Jujutsu' sorcerers
                        use mystical arts to exterminate them. When high school student
                        Yuji Itadori discovers the withered finger of the legendary Curse
                        of Sukuna Ryomen, he unexpectedly finds himself drawn into a
                        bloody conflict. Attacked by a Curse drawn by the power of the
                        finger, Yuuji makes a rash decision to defend himself, gaining the
                        power to fight the Curses in the process, but also unwittingly
                        releasing the malevolent Sukuna into the world once again.

                        Yuji is a young man of
                        average height and appears to have a slender build when wearing
                        baggy clothing, but actually has a lean and muscular physique. He
                        also has relatively large light brown eyes and spiky pink hair
                        (brownish blonde in the manga) that's styled in an undercut fashion.
                        When becoming the vessel for Sukuna after eating his finger, he
                        gains a second pair of eyes that only open when Sukuna controls his
                        body along with his many markings. At the start of the series, Yuji
                        wore a light-colored hooded jacket, high-cuffed black pants, and
                        white shoes. When Yuji enrolled into the Tokyo Metropolitan Curse
                        Technical College, he began wearing his version of the uniform; a
                        black long sleeve shirt resembling a gakuran over a red hoodie,
                        black pants, and red shoes. He gains a noticeable scar between his
                        two eyes and a smaller scar on his left labial commissure of the
                        mouth during the Shibuya Incident.
                        Yuji is a fair person who truly cares for not only his comrades but anyone he views as people
                        with their own wills, despite how deep or shallow his connection to them is. He highly commends
                        "the value of life," and to this end, he will ensure that others receive a "proper death".
                        Because of this, he believes that it is morally unethical for him to take another human life,
                        and tries to avoid any possibility of doing so unless as a last resort.
                        Yuji is one of Tokyo Jujutsu High's most powerful and talented students.
                        Satoru Gojo places him on the same level of potential as Yuta Okkotsu and Kinji Hakari, the
                        three students who he believes will surpass his strength.[6] Despite having no connections to
                        the jujutsu world before a few months prior to the Shibuya Incident, Yuji is able to contend
                        with and defeat Grade 1 and Special Grade curses. Yuji was gifted with superhuman physical
                        abilities which he masterfully combines with his cursed energy. Yuji is also able to contain
                        Sukuna with no ill effects, which allows him to perceive the shape of souls. This enables him to
                        harm Mahito, whose control over the shape of his soul otherwise renders him immune to injury.
                        Immense Strength: Yuji is quite powerful even without the usage of cursed energy, as he can
                        destroy walls with ease,[8] throw a lead ball with enough force to bend a soccer goalpost,[9]
                        and even throw a car.[10] As powerful as he is without cursed energy, especially when it comes
                        to fighting, his exceptional strength can often be augmented to further levels with the usage of
                        cursed energy, the Divergent Fist technique, and Black Flash, allowing him to exorcise cursed
                        spirits. His unique strength has also been compared to Kento Nanami, a Grade 1 sorcerer.

                    Satoru Gojo (五ご条じょう悟さとる Gojō Satoru?) is one of the
                    main protagonists of the Jujutsu Kaisen series. He is a special grade jujutsu sorcerer and
                    widely recognized as the strongest in the world. Satoru is the pride of the Gojo Family, the
                    first person to inherit both the Limitless and the Six Eyes in four hundred years. He works
                    as a teacher at the Tokyo Jujutsu High and uses his influence to protect and train strong
                    young allies.Even among the special grade sorcerers, Satoru
                    is known to be the strongest sorcerer in the series, holding both immense amounts of cursed
                    energy and a dangerously powerful technique. No one can seemingly match his skill level in the
                    current storyline, except for the King of Curses, Sukuna.
