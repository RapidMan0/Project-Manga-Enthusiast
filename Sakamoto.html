                        Tarou Sakamoto was considered the greatest hitman of all time. Feared by many, he stood at the
                        top of the underground world until he met and fell in love with a woman. As a result, Sakamoto
                        abandoned his life of crime and now works as a convenience store clerk.
                        Leaving his shady past behind proves more difficult than Sakamoto initially imagined. Many of
                        his former rivals and partners do not believe that he has truly left the business and show up in
                        hopes of taking him out. Barred from killing, Sakamoto must find creative ways to subdue his
                        enemies and prevent them from bringing harm to his family, his store, and the small town he
                        resides in.

                        Yuji is a young man of
                        average height and appears to have a slender build when wearing
                        baggy clothing, but actually has a lean and muscular physique. He
                        also has relatively large light brown eyes and spiky pink hair
                        (brownish blonde in the manga) that's styled in an undercut fashion.
                        When becoming the vessel for Sukuna after eating his finger, he
                        gains a second pair of eyes that only open when Sukuna controls his
                        body along with his many markings. At the start of the series, Yuji
                        wore a light-colored hooded jacket, high-cuffed black pants, and
                        white shoes. When Yuji enrolled into the Tokyo Metropolitan Curse
                        Technical College, he began wearing his version of the uniform; a
                        black long sleeve shirt resembling a gakuran over a red hoodie,
                        black pants, and red shoes. He gains a noticeable scar between his
                        two eyes and a smaller scar on his left labial commissure of the
                        mouth during the Shibuya Incident.
                        Yuji is a fair person who truly cares for not only his comrades but anyone he views as people
                        with their own wills, despite how deep or shallow his connection to them is. He highly commends
                        "the value of life," and to this end, he will ensure that others receive a "proper death".
                        Because of this, he believes that it is morally unethical for him to take another human life,
                        and tries to avoid any possibility of doing so unless as a last resort.
                        Yuji is one of Tokyo Jujutsu High's most powerful and talented students.
                        Satoru Gojo places him on the same level of potential as Yuta Okkotsu and Kinji Hakari, the
                        three students who he believes will surpass his strength.[6] Despite having no connections to
                        the jujutsu world before a few months prior to the Shibuya Incident, Yuji is able to contend
                        with and defeat Grade 1 and Special Grade curses. Yuji was gifted with superhuman physical
                        abilities which he masterfully combines with his cursed energy. Yuji is also able to contain
                        Sukuna with no ill effects, which allows him to perceive the shape of souls. This enables him to
                        harm Mahito, whose control over the shape of his soul otherwise renders him immune to injury.
                        Immense Strength: Yuji is quite powerful even without the usage of cursed energy, as he can
                        destroy walls with ease,[8] throw a lead ball with enough force to bend a soccer goalpost,[9]
                        and even throw a car.[10] As powerful as he is without cursed energy, especially when it comes
                        to fighting, his exceptional strength can often be augmented to further levels with the usage of
                        cursed energy, the Divergent Fist technique, and Black Flash, allowing him to exorcise cursed
                        spirits. His unique strength has also been compared to Kento Nanami, a Grade 1 sorcerer.

                    Satoru Gojo (五ご条じょう悟さとる Gojō Satoru?) is one of the
                    main protagonists of the Jujutsu Kaisen series. He is a special grade jujutsu sorcerer and
                    widely recognized as the strongest in the world. Satoru is the pride of the Gojo Family, the
                    first person to inherit both the Limitless and the Six Eyes in four hundred years. He works
                    as a teacher at the Tokyo Jujutsu High and uses his influence to protect and train strong
                    young allies.Even among the special grade sorcerers, Satoru
                    is known to be the strongest sorcerer in the series, holding both immense amounts of cursed
                    energy and a dangerously powerful technique. No one can seemingly match his skill level in the
                    current storyline, except for the King of Curses, Sukuna.

                        Toji is a tall, muscular man with mid-length straight black hair that reaches to his ears. His
                        eyes are green, just like his son's, and he has thin black eyebrows and a scar on the corner of
                        his right lip.
                        For casual attire, Toji wears a simple outfit consisting of a long-sleeved shirt and matching
                        pants with sandals. While fighting, Toji wears a tight-fitting short sleeve shirt, sports tan
                        baggy training pants with a black belt weaved through the waist and black martial arts slippers.
                        While still a member of the Zenin family, Toji wore a dark colored haori over a black yukata.
                        Overall Skill Level: While Toji is technically a non-curse user with no innate talent for
                        jujutsu, he was one of the most elite fighters in the jujutsu world when he was alive. With
                        innate physical prowess far superior to all others in his path, Toji contended with the most
                        dangerous and highly ranked jujutsu practitioners this era had to offer.He was able to defeat
                        the strongest jujutsu sorcerers at the time without sustaining any injuries beyond a small cut
                        around the ear, one of which was a young Satoru Gojo, a prodigy who possessed the Six Eyes and
                        Limitless cursed technique.[16] The other was the curse manipulator Suguru Geto, a powerful
                        grade 1 sorcerer that would reach special grade a year later. Toji was able to effortlessly take
                        down Suguru along with several of his strongest cursed spirits. Toji referred to Suguru's
                        abilities as rabble compared to his own strength.
                        Toji used the jujutsu knowledge from the Zenin family and turned it against sorcerers, earning
                        him the moniker of "Sorcerer Killer." During the Star Plasma Vessel Escort Mission, an
                        assignment given to the two strongest sorcerers by Master Tengen, Toji was hired by the Time
                        Vessel Association to assassinate the Star Plasma Vessel. Toji was able to completely derail the
                        escort through a series of tactical moves over a few days. This wore down the escort team and
                        lured them into a false sense of security before he abruptly made his move.

                    Nobara is a confident and brash young woman with an unshakable character. More than anything, Nobara
                    is determined to stay true to herself no matter what.[4] She takes great pride in being both a
                    pretty girl and a strong fighter, refusing to let anyone influence her. Overall, Skill Level: Nobara
                    is ranked as a grade 3 jujutsu sorcerer by Jujutsu High. This is mostly due to her status as a young
                    first-year student and inexperience working as a sorcerer.
                    Nobara has showcased numerous times the capability to contend with jujutsu users ranked leagues
                    above in terms of grade. Coming into school, Nobara had a solid understanding of how to exorcise
                    curses with her innate technique.[21] She also had the mental fortitude to handle the job but lacked
                    physical ability. While fighting in the Eishu Detention Center, Nobara defended herself adequately
                    until she ran out of nails to fight with. Afterward, Maki took Nobara under her wing and trained her
                    to improve her physical prowess. The training included heavy stamina conditioning and getting used
                    to getting knocked down Panda.[23] By the time of the Goodwill Event, Nobara showcased she was in
                    much better shape as a close-combat fighter. In Nobara's fight with Momo, the Kyoto third year had
                    the advantage of flying above Nobara on her
                    broom. Nobara eventually figured out a way to outmaneuver Momo by using the environment to her
                    advantage. Nobara was able to last long enough in that fight due to Maki and Panda's training. She
                    was knocked down several times by gusts of cursed energy wind, but Nobara endured until she figured
                    out a way to counterattack.Despite ultimately being eliminated from the Goodwill Event, Nobara has
                    since demonstrated the potential to combat special grade curses. Alongside Yuji, Nobara was able to
                    fight on even terms with Eso and Kechizu. Both the students were poisoned by the Death Painting's
                    blood technique, but Nobara used that connection against her adversaries. Thanks to her cleverness
                    and ability to think clearly in high-pressure situations, Nobara instantly figured out a way to
                    counter her opponent's technique. Nobara's adaptability and fearlessness lead her to use Resonance
                    on herself to injure Eso and
                    Kechizu at the same time. This involved stabbing herself with nails to activate Resonance, but
                    Nobara was more than happy to do so. The poison, as well as the pain from stabbing herself, helped
                    Nobara enter a state of extreme focus, allowing her to unleash the power of Black Flash as well.
                    Nobara and Yuji defeated the special grade curses, prompting Mei Mei (via payment from Satoru) and
                    Todo to recommend her and all her peers for grade 1.
